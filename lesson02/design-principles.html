            <h2>Contrast</h2>
            <p>Contrast deals with highlighting the differences between design elements. For example here in this
                screenshot it helps draw attention to
                specific areas and put the viewer in a state of being interested in what they are viewing. Using
                contrasting colors, fonts, or sizes to make important
                elements stand out, like the image, the words, and also the background not interfering with the entire
                view.</p>

            <h2>Alignment</h2>
            <p>Alignment also does with the arranging of elements along a common line or edge. It brings a sense of
                order and
                agrrement to a design. Good alignment helps create a visually appealing and balanced layout, like in the
                example above the images and the words explaining them are written in a well aligned manner, making it
                possible for the viewer to see it all clearly and orderly, as they are aligned along the left side
                flowing down.</p>

            <h2>White Space and Clean Design</h2>
            <p>White space (or negative space) is the empty space between design elements. It helps reduce the struggle
                an individual gets while seeing through closely fitted stuffs and allows the viewer to focus on the
                essential elements. Clean design emphasizes simplicity,
                clarity, and forsakes the idea of wanting to fill all the space with somethings that don't matter.</p>
