            <h2>Introduction to css media queries</h2>
            <div>
                <p>Media Query is a css technique that uses the @media rule to include a block of css properties only if
                    a certain condition is true.</p>
                <p>we write that code like this
                    <br> @media screen and (here we put the condition for a break point for example, max-width:600px)
                </p>
                <p>This technique helps programmers deliver a specific style sheet, to desktops, laptops, and mobile
                    phones.</p>

            <h2>screen sizes</h2>
            <div>
                <p>media queries can be used to check, width and height of the viewport, orientation of the viewport and
                    also the resolution
                </p>

                <h2>Recommended to design mobile first</h2>
                <p>since mobile phones are now so common, and people use them more easily, its best when designing a web
                    application, that the programmer starts with the design for such, and then later create a media
                    query that can apply to lager screen sizes</p>

            <h2>Testing on different screen sizes</h2>
            <div>
                <p>It is important to test on different screen sizes before deploying, as we know that a programmer
                    needs to ensure that his/her application is user friendly for all users with different devices. </p>
